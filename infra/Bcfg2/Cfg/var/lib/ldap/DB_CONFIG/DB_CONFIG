#Set the size of the shared memory buffer pool -- that is, the cache -- 
#to gbytes gigabytes plus bytes. The cache should be the size of the 
#normal working data set of the application, with some small amount of 
#additional memory for unusual situations. (Note: the working set is not 
#the same as the number of pages accessed simultaneously, and should be 
#quite a bit larger!)
#The default cache size is 256KB, and may not be specified as less than 
#20KB. Any cache size less than 500MB is automatically increased by 25% 
#to account for buffer pool overhead; cache sizes larger than 500MB are 
#used as specified. The current maximum size of a single cache is 4GB.
#JMD: 256 Megs cache

# Set the size of the underlying logging subsystem region, in bytes. 
# By default, or if the value is set to 0, the base region size is 60KB. 
# The log region is used to store filenames, and so may need to be 
# increased in size if a large number of files will be opened and registered 
# with the specified Berkeley DB environment's log manager.
set_lg_regionmax 1048576


# Set the size of the in-memory log buffer, in bytes. By default, or if 
# the value is set to 0, a size of 32K is used. The size of the log 
# file (see DB_ENV->set_lg_max) must be at least four times the size of 
# the in-memory log buffer.
# JMD: 2MB
set_lg_bsize 2097152


# Set the maximum size of a single file in the log, in bytes. 
# Because DB_LSN file offsets are unsigned four-byte values, the set 
# value may not be larger than the maximum unsigned four-byte value. 
# By default, or if the value is set to 0, a size of 10MB is used. 
# The size of the log file must be at least four times the size of the 
# in-memory log buffer (see DB_ENV->set_lg_bsize).

# Number of locks (both requested and granted)
# Set the maximum number of locks supported by the Berkeley DB lock 
# subsystem. This value is used by DB_ENV->open to estimate how much 
# space to allocate for various lock-table data structures. The default 
# value is 1000 locks. For specific information on configuring the size 
# of the lock subsystem, see 
# http://pybsddb.sourceforge.net/ref/lock/max.html
